# Product Description

---

## Product Objective

The main objective of this project is to develop the **functional backend** for the appointment request module of the proposed website for the **Faculty of Psychology at the Autonomous University of Yucat√°n (UADY)**.

Currently, the faculty manages its appointments using paper records, which limits the efficiency and accessibility of the service. Based on a previously designed mockup, our team will be responsible for programming the server logic that will enable appointment requests to be managed digitally.

---

## Scope

The project will focus exclusively on server implementation, covering the following points:

* **Backend implementation** for the appointment request form.
* **Receipt, validation, and storage of data** sent by users.
* **Design of endpoints*** for request management (e.g., appointment creation, simulated availability verification).
* **Preparation of the structure** for future integration with real databases and institutional systems.
* **Use of best practices** in web development and application of basic security in data management.

## Limitations

The following features or components are **not part of the scope** of this project:

* **Frontend Development:** The development of the user interface is not included, as it was provided as a mockup (static design).
* **Authentication and Administration:** User authentication and the implementation of an administrative panel for faculty are not included.
* **Connection to Real Institutional Database:** The system will not be connected to a real institutional database; **simulated storage** will be used for development and testing purposes (at least initially).
* **Advanced Appointment Control:** Real-time availability control and automatic appointment confirmation or scheduling are not implemented.
