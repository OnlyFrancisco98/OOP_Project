## Process Digitization

We transformed the current paper-based, manual appointment management system into a **digital solution**. This allows for **automated reception and management of requests**, significantly improving the faculty's operational efficiency and the user experience when requesting appointments.

## Personalized Approach (Tailor-Made)

## Basis for Future Expansion

Although this is an initial version with defined scope, the system is designed with a **robust and scalable architecture**. This facilitates the **future integration** of advanced features such as:

* Connection to institutional databases.
* User authentication.
* Administrative panels.
