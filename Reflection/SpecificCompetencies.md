### 1. Identifying the Object-Oriented Paradigm

- The team understood and applied concepts such as classes, objects, attributes, and methods in the website's backend, organizing the code into clear and reusable structures.

### 2. Abstracting Classes and Objects

- They designed models such as User, Product, Comment, etc., encapsulating relevant data and behaviors for each entity in the system, thus facilitating business logic.

### 3. Applying Aggregation, Composition, and Inheritance

- They implemented relationships between classes: for example, a ShoppingCart that aggregates products, or an Administrator class that inherits from User, reusing and extending functionalities.

### 4. Fault-Tolerant Development Using Exceptions

- They used try-catch blocks to handle errors such as database connection failures, invalid inputs, or authentication errors, ensuring that the website does not crash due to unforeseen events.

### 5. Implementation of layered architecture and MVC

- They separated the system into model (data), view (web interface), and controller (interaction logic), allowing for more efficient maintenance, scalability, and collaboration among programmers.
