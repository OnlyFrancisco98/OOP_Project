# Process Management

During this first stage of the project, process management was carried out through a combination of face-to-face meetings and virtual video calls, where activities were organized, responsibilities were assigned, and deadlines were established.

## Monitoring and Follow-up

Task monitoring was conducted collaboratively, with agreements documented during each meeting and deliverables reviewed on a regular basis. Adapted **Scrum** principles were applied: in each meeting, completed tasks, pending activities, and potential obstacles were reviewed. Clear responsibilities were assigned according to the project checklist.

## Tools Used

* **Video calls and face-to-face meetings**: to discuss agreements, resolve conflicts, and coordinate workload.
* **Shared online documents**: used to draft and centralize deliverables (requirements, artifacts, etc.).
* **Meeting records**: each meeting generated a set of tasks with responsible members and deadlines, functioning as a monitoring log.

## Meeting Log (example)

In summary, process management focused on continuous coordination through meetings, clear task assignment, the use of collaborative tools, and the maintenance of a meeting log that facilitated team monitoring and progress tracking.
