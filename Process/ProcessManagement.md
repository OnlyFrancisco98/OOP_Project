# Process Management

During this second phase of the project, process management was carried out through a combination of in-person meetings and video calls. Activities were organized, responsibilities were assigned, and deadlines were established, all of which were in line with the limited time available for the second deliverable.

# Monitoring

Task monitoring was performed collaboratively, with agreements documented at each meeting and deliverables reviewed periodically. Adapted **Scrum** principles were applied: in each meeting, completed tasks, pending activities, and potential obstacles were reviewed. Clear responsibilities were assigned according to the project checklist. This helped improve project management organization, as the second deliverable started late and time was our biggest concern.

# Tools Used

* **Meeting with the Professor**: This meeting was the most important as we focused the project, considering what we can and must do to deliver it within the given timeframe.

* **Video Calls and In-Person Meetings**: Used to discuss agreements, resolve conflicts, and coordinate workload.

* **Shared Online Documents**: Used to draft and centralize deliverables (requirements, artifacts, etc.).

* **Meeting Minutes**: Each meeting generated a set of tasks with assigned responsibilities and deadlines, serving as a progress log.
