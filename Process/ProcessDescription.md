# Process Description

For the development of the website project, specifically in this first stage focused on documentation, the team established a work process based on the agile methodology **Scrum**. This approach allowed the team to stay organized, define responsibilities, and coordinate activities effectively.

The team consists of five members, each assigned different tasks according to the checklist provided. To align with Scrum, the following roles were assigned:

## Scrum Roles Assignment

| Team Member                            | Scrum Role       | Main Responsibility                                          |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Cristofer Aldair Barrera Escalante** | Development Team | Documentation of functional and non-functional requirements  |
| **Kevin Antonio Canto Díaz**           | Development Team | Documentation of functional requirements, artifacts          |
| **José Francisco Montero UC**          | Product Owner    | Defining requirements, ensuring alignment with project goals |
| **José Heynar Sandoval Tamayo**        | Scrum Master     | Facilitating meetings, monitoring progress, prioritization   |
| **Héctor Adrián Rosado Yama**          | Development Team | Process description, participation in presentation           |

Team organization was managed through both face-to-face meetings and video calls, where planning, task distribution, and delivery times were defined. Each member had a specific responsibility, while maintaining constant collaboration to ensure alignment across all deliverables.

The activities were carried out collaboratively and iteratively, with drafts being reviewed and refined through team feedback before the final submission. This ensured coherence among the deliverables and alignment with the overall project objectives.

In conclusion, the process followed during this first stage combines the structured organization of an academic team with principles from the agile methodology **Scrum**, highlighting collaboration, continuous communication, and the adaptation of roles to achieve the required documentation deliverables.
