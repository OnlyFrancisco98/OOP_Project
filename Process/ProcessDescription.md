# ProcessDescription

During this final delivery, the sprints and their respective durations were carried out differently, as the backlog was used to store the available tasks. In this delivery, each team member focused on their assigned tasks, which were chosen based on their strengths, making it easier for them to complete them within the delivery timeframe. The delivery was divided into three sprints.

The first phase, from November 10th to 16th, involved the following tasks:
- Competencies
- Artifact Refinement
- RF/RNF Verification
- Presentation Formatting

The second phase, from November 17th to 23rd, involved the following tasks:
- Contribution Metrics
- Process Description
- Process Management
- Requirements Evolution

The third phase, from November 23rd to 30th, involved the following tasks:
- Areas for Improvement
- Product Evolution
- Adding Field Verification
- Application Deployment

There were also tasks for which the time required was not recorded, as these were the most difficult and for which no estimated time was available. These included:
- Use of MVC
- Creation and deployment of the database
- Abstraction process
- Adding email functionality
- Organization and documentation of the repository
