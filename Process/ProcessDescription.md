# Process Description
During this second phase of the project, it was decided to continue using the Scrum agile methodology. This allowed the team to maintain its work pace, as they had become familiar with it during the first phase, remaining organized, defining responsibilities, and coordinating activities effectively.

The team consists of five members, each of whom was assigned different tasks according to the provided checklist. To align with Scrum, the following roles were assigned:

## Scrum Roles Assignment

| Team Member                            | Scrum Role       | Main Responsibility                                             |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------    |
| **Cristofer Aldair Barrera Escalante** | Development Team | Process description and process monitoring                      |
| **Kevin Antonio Canto Díaz**           | Development Team | Evolution of functional requirements and artifacts              |
| **José Francisco Montero UC**          | Product Owner    | Evolution of requirements and alignment with project objectives |
| **José Heynar Sandoval Tamayo**        | Scrum Master     | Facilitating Meetings and Prioritizing                          |
| **Héctor Adrián Rosado Yama**          | Development Team | Participation in Presentations and Competitions                 |

During this second delivery, we improved aspects that weren't entirely clear in the previous one. One of these was the project's focus, as we defined the limits of what we can and want to do within the remaining time.

In the requirements section, improvements were made: some were redefined, others expanded, and still others discarded due to our work methodology.

The activities were carried out collaboratively and iteratively, and the drafts were reviewed and refined with team feedback before the final delivery. This ensured consistency among the deliverables and their alignment with the overall project objectives.

During this second delivery, small code snippets were created that will serve as drafts for the final version of the project.

In conclusion, during this delivery, we defined what we can do and what our focus will be throughout the project, prioritizing the remaining time. We also improved some aspects compared to the first delivery.
