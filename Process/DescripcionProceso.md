# Process Description

For the development of the website project, specifically in this first stage focused on documentation, the team established a work process based on the agile methodology **Scrum**. This approach allowed the team to stay organized, define responsibilities, and coordinate activities effectively.

The team consists of five members, each assigned different tasks according to the checklist provided. Although the formal Scrum roles were not assigned in their entirety, a practical adaptation was applied. The **Product Owner** role was represented by the member in charge of prioritizing and defining functional and non-functional requirements, the **Scrum Master** acted as the facilitator who organized meetings and monitored progress, and the **Development Team** was represented collectively by all members, each focusing on their assigned documentation tasks.

Team organization was managed through both face-to-face meetings and video calls, where planning, task distribution, and delivery times were defined. Each member had a specific responsibility: some worked on functional and non-functional requirements, others on prioritization and artifacts, while the section *“Process Description”* was individually developed by one member.

The activities were carried out collaboratively and iteratively, with drafts being reviewed and refined through team feedback before the final submission. This ensured coherence among the deliverables and alignment with the overall project objectives.

In conclusion, the process followed during this first stage combines the structured organization of an academic team with principles from the agile methodology **Scrum**, highlighting collaboration, continuous communication, and the adaptation of roles to achieve the required documentation deliverables.
