| **Develop applications using the MVC architecture.**                        | Promoted by implementing requirement RF5 (access code) while dividing the project into model, view, and controller classes, following the MVC design pattern.                 |
| **Apply software engineering principles throughout the development cycle.** | Fostered by performing analysis, design, and individual testing of each requirement (such as RF5 and RF7) before integration, ensuring structured and functional development. |
| **Integrate automated communication features into web systems.**            | Strengthened by implementing the functionality to send the access code to the user’s email, using Java libraries to connect the system with an email service.                 |
